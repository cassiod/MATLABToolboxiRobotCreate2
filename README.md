* Sensor Reading 
** Distance and Angle Readings are wrong    <----- Major Issue
** Schedule and Clock Buttons do not work

* Examples to add
** Basic Object Avoidance - relied on waitDist. Preferably fix waitDist and keep same example as with Create1
** Example of Keyboard Control - This was kind of cool on the Create1 but not necessary. Fixing waitDist/Angle should fix it.
** Output Example - LED and Beep examples.

* To Implement
** TravelDist and TurnAngle are no longer supported due to the lack of waitAngle and waitDist on the Create2. A replacement can be written.
** LED functions need to be looked at in general
** SetLED for digits - Create2 has a 4 digit ASCII display. A function
